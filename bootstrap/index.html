                        <p>There are three main ways in which CSS links HTML.<br> They are: Inline, Internal, and External. Inline is where <br> CSS is applied to one element in a page. This is done <br> in the HTML code by adding the style attribute to the <br> HTML tag. Internal is where CSS is written in the web<br>pages header. The code for this will be placed in style <br> tags so the browser knows to read it as CSS code. <br>External is where each style will be applied to any of the<br> HTML tags. This reduces CSS styles needing to be. This<br>is written in a .CSS file which is then saved seperately.</p>

                        <h3>CSS Box Model</h3>
                        <p>The Box Model is essentially a box which wraps around every HTML element. This consists of: margins, borders,padding and the actual content. The Margin is a clear box around the border of the content. The Margin is a specific area that has been coded. It is in between the browser and the border. It gives the content enough space from the egde of the web page. The Border has different values which is used to design the element. The border is used to make the content stand out more. This can be done by changing the thickness, style or colour. The Padding gives space between the border and the content. The Padding is transparent. It clears an area around the content. The Content is what is actually on the webpage.This can vary from page to page, it is up to the designer what it looks like. This is done using CSS and HTML.</p>

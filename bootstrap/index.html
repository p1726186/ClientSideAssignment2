                        <p>There are three main ways in which CSS<br> links HTML. They are: Inline, Internal, and External. Inline<br>is where CSS is applied to one element in a page. This is<br> done in the HTML code by the style the HTML tag. Internal<br> is where CSS is written in the web pages header. The code<br> for this will be placed in style tags so the browser knows to<br>read it as CSS code. External is each style will be applied<br>to any of the HTML tags. This reduces CSS styles to be.<br> This is written in a .CSS file which is then saved seperately.</p>

                        <h3>CSS Box Model</h3>
                        <p>The Box Model is essentially a box which wraps around every HTML element. This consists of: <br> margins, borders, padding and the actual content. The Margin is a clear box around the border <br> of the content. The Margin is a specific area that has been coded. It is in between the browser <br> and the border. It gives the content enough space from the edge of the web page. The Border <br> has different values which is used to design the element. The border is used to make the <br> content stand out more. This can be done by changing the thickness, style or colour. The <br> Padding gives space between the border and the content. The Padding is transparent. It <br> clears an area around the content. The Content is what is actually on the webpage.This can <br> vary from page to page, it is up to the designer what it looks like. This is done using CSS and <br> HTML.</p>
